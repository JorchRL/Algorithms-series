I want to offer a course about algorithms. Somewhat rigorous, but at the same
time accessible.

But we need to start with some basics first. We will start by getting a taste of
the kind of _work_ we are going to be doing. We are going to be doing _proofs_
about the behaviour of algorithms.

In this post I will show you a mathematical proof about numbers.

## Reasoning with numbers

Lets start with an interesting observation:

**Observation:** the sum of any three digits is at most two digits long.

In base 10 we can check this easily by noting that $9+9+9 = 27$. Yet we would
like to make a more general claim.

**Lemma 1:** For any integer base $b \geq 2$, the sum of any three digits is at
most two digits long.

> A lemma is a claim that we need to prove using mathematical resoning alone. No
> "empirical evidence" allowed!

Before offering the proof, lets take a moment to reason through what we are even
asking!

The way to proceed can be to find out what is the biggest number we can
represent with a single base $b$ digit. Think for example, base 10, where $9 =
10^1 - 1$. In base 2, we have that $1 = 2^1-1$. In base 16 (hexadecimal), $15 =
\text{F} = 16^1 - 1$. And so on. Can you see it?

Then consider the number $b^1-1$ which must be the biggest one-digit base $b$
number. Thus we need to ask, how many digits does $3(b^1-1)$ has? Now we have
enough to attempt a proof.

**Proof:** First note that as $b^1-1 > 0$, then $3(b^1-1)$ must be bigger than
$b^1-1$. If that is the case, then it must also be at least two-digits long,
because $b^1-1$ is the biggest one-digit base $b$ number!

Second, consider the biggest two-digit base $b$ number. It must be
$(b^2-1)+(b^1-1)$.

To help see it, consider the concrete example for base 10.

$$99 = (10^2 - 1) + (10^1 - 1) = 90 + 9 $$

But we can show that:

$$ 3(b^1-1) < b^2-1 < b^2-1+b^1-1 $$

If you are not convinced, try checking the inequality for $b = 2, 3, 4, ...$

> - Hint 2: what is $\frac{b^2-1}{b-1}$ ?

Therefore, by our first statement above $3(b^1-1)$ must be at least two-digits
long. As it is larger than the largest one-digit base $b$ number. But by the
second statement, it cannot be three or more digits long. As it is smaller than
the biggest possible two-digit base $b$ number.

But $3(b^1-a)$ is the biggest possible number we can have by adding three
one-digit number. And it must be two-digits long at most. So there is no other
such number that could be more than two digits long.

We must conclude that _any_ sum of three one-digit numbers base $b \geq 2$ must
be _at most_ two digits long. This completes our proof.

### Wow. That was dense.

We can be a little bit more terse when writing proofs, without loosing rigor. As
long as we are confident the reader will be able to fill in the blanks.

**Terse proof**: Let $A = 3(b-1)$ where $b-1$ is the biggest one-digit base $b$
number. And $B = b^2-1 < C = (b^2-1)+(b-1)$, with $C$ being the largest
two-digit base $b$ number. Then, $A \leq B < C$. But as $B$ is two-digits long,
$A$ can only have at most two digits. This completes the proof.

The point is that, you can (and perhaps should) write a reasoning as detailed as
you need, to understand it completely. Some proofs are simple enough that we can
skip them. Some will need a more elaborate reasoning.

I will take this approach on this posts :D

**Try it yourself!:** Show that the sum of any two base $b \geq 2$ one digit
numbers has at most two digits. Is that true? Why?

## About this posts

This series is about algorithms and, to a lesser extent, data structures. If you
want to follow along, however, please note that I am not aiming this at complete
beginners.

I will foolishly assume you are at least familiar with:

- Basic data structures like arrays, lists, trees and hash tables.
- Big O notation. You know what "linear time" means.
- You are at least willing to follow through some mathematical proofs.

That being said. I always try to keep my writting as accessible as possible :D

This are basically my notes from taking the "Intro to graduate algorithms" class
from georgia tech. Which is freely available online (I am not enrolled).

> As you can probably imagine from the name, it is a graduate-level course. I
> will be following closely the book used. "Algorithms" by Dasgupta,
> Papadimitriou & Vazirani (2006).

\* Plase note that "we can convince ourselves", "as you should verify" and other
such comments are code for "you should write the proof yourself in a piece of
paper. I'm too lazy to do it myself!""

## Epilogue

Hopefully that was interesting and my writing was simple enough. If you want to
follow along, I encourage you to go through the reasoning with pen and paper :D

I would appreciate any feedback (specially if I am wrong!!!). I am not an
expert. I am learning, just like you!
