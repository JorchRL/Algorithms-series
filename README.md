## Algorithms Notes

This repo holds my notes following through Georgia Tech's "Intro to graduate
Algorithms" course. Which is freely available. I am mostly following the book.

The `posts` folder includes the posts in GitHub markdown, so they can be read
here.

The `hashnode_version` folder includes the same posts but with changes so that
the math renders correctly on Hashnode.
