## Algorithms Notes

This repo holds my notes following through Georgia Tech's "Intro to graduate
Algorithms" course. Which is freely available. I am mostly following the book.

The `posts` folder includes the posts in GitHub markdown, so they can be read
here.

The `hashnode_version` folder includes the same posts but with changes so that
the math renders correctly on Hashnode.

## Give me feedback!!

I am learning this. So if I make a mistake or something is not explained
clearly. Or if you have any kind of feedback please open an issue and I'll try
to address it!

The idea is that I want to iterate my learning by receiving feedback. And I
figured that GitHub would be good for that.

I want to automate the "hashnodify" process so that everything in `posts` is
automagically formatted correctly for Hashnode. And I can upload it from GitHub,
so that any new post, or change could be sent to Hashnode with automation!

(If you wanna help with that please let me know :D)
